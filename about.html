                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <h2>Hi, I'm Jayden Wong!</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm a computer science student from New Zealand who first got into coding through my love for video games. I was fascinated by how games were made and wanted to create my own. This curiosity led me down the path of game development, where I discovered my passion for programming and technology.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Over time, my interests have expanded beyond game design to include <strong>artificial intelligence, robotics, and web development</strong>. I enjoy exploring new fields and technologies, always looking for opportunities to learn and create something new.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Outside of coding, I have a range of hobbies that keep me active and engaged. I enjoy skiing during the winter months, taking in the thrill of the slopes and the beauty of the mountains. I'm also an avid gamer and movie enthusiast, always up for a good story or an intense challenge. I love playing the guitar, spending my downtime learning new songs and experimenting with different styles. Whether it's music, conquering a difficult game level, or diving into a new film, I love experiences that offer creativity and excitement.
                </p>
